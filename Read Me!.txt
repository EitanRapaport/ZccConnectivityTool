The ZCC connectivity tool
Version 1.0


The tool was designed to save time on cases where we need to perform mass connectivity checks from the ZCC to both customer and CSP environments.
The tool will by default run 10 pings to each entry in the iptables unless specified otherwise in the relevant parameter.
The tool will also telnet each ZVM over port 9081 and each VRA over ports 4007 and 4008.

While it is running, the tool will create a file called "Connectivity test output.txt" which will contain the results of the test.
Please make sure to upload the file to the Zerto support ticket if relevant.


### For security reasons, it is recommended to download the tool and place a new copy of it on the environment in the beginning of each session. ###

### Running the tool ###

1) Download the ZIP file into the Zerto installation folder and extract it. 
For the tool to properly run, it must be placed in a subfolder under the Zerto installation folder.
2) Run the "Connectivity tool.ps1" file(Right click -> Run/Run with PowerShell)
3) Fill the relevant fields and hit enter at the end.
